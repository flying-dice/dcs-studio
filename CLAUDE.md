# dcs-studio

A desktop IDE (Tauri + SvelteKit) for DCS World mission/mod development: project
explorer, CodeMirror editor, live Lua console against a running sim, and managers
for installing the in-DCS bridge DLL and toggling MissionScripting.lua sanitization.

## Model-driven engineering (mandatory workflow)

The PseudoScript model in `model/` is the **spec**, not documentation-after-the-fact.
Every change that touches behavior or architecture follows this order:

1. **Draft the model first.** Update (or add to) the relevant `model/*.pds` module
   to express the intended change — new callables, data shapes, error paths,
   features. Run `pds check <file>` until clean and `pds fmt --write <file>`.
2. **Make the change.** Implement in Rust/TypeScript, translating the model
   faithfully: every disclosed branch and `Err` arm in the model must exist in
   the code, in the same order. Black-box signatures are the contracts adapters
   must satisfy.
3. **Update the model.** If implementation forced deviations (renamed methods,
   extra error paths, changed shapes), reconcile the model before finishing.
   The model and code must not disagree at the end of a task.

Rules of thumb:

- A business decision (guard, authorization, state transition, derivation) that
  exists in code but not in a disclosed model body is a model bug — add it.
- Plumbing (serialization, status codes, retries, DI wiring) never goes in the model.
- Cross-system calls target the `Dcs` system's published face (`Ping`/`Eval`/`Invoke`),
  never its internal containers.
- New acceptance behavior gets a `feature` scenario on the owning node.

PseudoScript reference: `pds skill` (method), `pds lang` (grammar). Useful commands:
`pds check <file>`, `pds fmt --write <file>`, `pds eval` (stdin snippet check),
`cd model && pds doc` (site under `model/target/doc`, gitignored),
`pds svg --symbol <FQN>` (single diagram).

Model gotchas learned here: `data` is a reserved word (no fields named `data`);
constants only take non-negative primitive literals (JSON-RPC codes live in docs).

### Model map

| Module | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `model/studio/core.pds` | `Studio` system, `Workbench` UI container (editor, console, dual-path `DcsCall`) |
| `model/studio/files.pds` | `WorkspaceFs` — fs commands, project scaffolding (`crates/app/src/fs.rs`) |
| `model/studio/link.pds` | `DcsLink` heartbeat + `BridgeClient` (`crates/app/src/dcs.rs`, `crates/dcs-bridge-client`) |
| `model/studio/inject.pds` | `Injector` — bridge DLL/hook install (`crates/app/src/inject.rs`) |
| `model/studio/mission.pds` | `MissionScripting` sanitization manager (`crates/app/src/mission.rs`) |
| `model/dcs/bridge.pds` | `Dcs` system: GameGUI hook, JSON-RPC server/router (`crates/dcs-bridge`) |

## Architecture

Two processes joined by WebSocket JSON-RPC on `ws://127.0.0.1:25569/ws`:

- **Editor**: SvelteKit frontend (`src/`) inside a Tauri shell (`crates/app`), which
  embeds `crates/dcs-bridge-client` (reconnecting WS client, string ids only — the
  server's serde rejects numeric ids).
- **In-DCS bridge**: `crates/dcs-bridge` builds `dcs_bridge.dll` (mlua cdylib +
  actix WS server), loaded by the GameGUI hook
  `crates/dcs-bridge/deploy/Scripts/Hooks/DcsStudio.lua`. Requests queue and are
  drained once per simulation frame — frames fire at the main menu too, so RPCs
  answer from boot; a mission is live only when the pong's `dcs_time` > 0.

In a plain browser (vite dev, Playwright) there is no Tauri IPC: `dcsCall` falls
back to `src/lib/dcs-ws.ts`, speaking the same wire protocol directly.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — frontend only at `http://localhost:1420`
- `pnpm tauri:dev` — full desktop app
- `pnpm check` — svelte-check / TypeScript
- `cargo build -p dcs-bridge --release` — build the bridge DLL (release profile is
  what the in-app Injection Manager picks up)
- `cargo check --workspace` / `cargo test --workspace` — Rust
- `pnpm test:e2e` — Playwright suite (`e2e/`); drives the real UI against a real
  DCS instance, launching DCS if the bridge isn't already up. One worker, ~1 min
  cold start. Don't run it casually; report with `pnpm test:report`.

For live work against DCS (deploy the DLL, launch/control the sim, eval Lua),
use the `dcs-dev` skill.

## Gotchas

- **Lua linking**: `.cargo/config.toml` pins `LUA_LIB`/`LUA_LIB_NAME` to
  `crates/dcs-bridge/lua5.1` so the DLL links DCS's own `lua.dll`. Without it,
  cargo silently links `lua51.dll` and `require("dcs_bridge")` fails inside DCS.
- **JSON-RPC ids are strings**: a numeric id kills the server's WS read task.
- A DLL locked by a running DCS cannot be overwritten — injection surfaces this.
